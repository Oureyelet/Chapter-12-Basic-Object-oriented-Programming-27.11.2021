    When writing your code, sometimes you’ll run across cases where you’re not sure whether one method or another will be 
    more performant. So how do you tell?

    One easy way is to time your code to see how long it takes to run. C++11 comes with some functionality in the chrono

    encapsulate all the timing functionality we need into a class that we can then use in our own programs.

    Here’s the class:
